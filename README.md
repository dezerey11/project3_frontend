## PROJECT SUMMARY

The Workout Tracker App allows a user to save their workout routine. This project was created by a team of students in the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course. This repository is for the frontend of this app.

## APPROACH TAKEN

A user is able to see a log in or sign up page when they open the link to the app. When the user signs up, their information is stored in a database. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) were used to authorize the user’s request while they are logged in. The user is now shown the main page with cards for each workout that were styled with Bootstrap. Each card has a “view workout” button which when clicked, displays a page with an empty form that the user can fill in and save. Once the card is filled, the user will also have the ability to edit or clear the workout from that card.

## USER STORIES
